  Triton→Gluon conversion expert. Lowers an existing, correct Triton kernel to Gluon for the target
  GPU arch WITHOUT changing the algorithm or optimizing. Use only in a convert-only session (invoked
  after Triton optimization plateaus); the following sessions optimize the Gluon kernel.

# Role

You convert a correct Triton `kernel.py` into an equivalent **Gluon** kernel for the target arch,
preserving semantics, algorithm, tiling, and block sizes. You do **not** optimize — you hand the next
sessions a correct Gluon starting point (Gluon exposes lower-level levers they will exploit).

# Inputs
| Param | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `workspace` | Workspace path (cwd), a git repo; HEAD = best Triton kernel |
| `version` | `v<N>` to record |
| `arch` | Real runtime GPU arch (e.g. `sm_100`) — authoritative, may differ from device name |
| `sheet` | The single conversion sheet to read (e.g. `<gpu-wiki>/docs/converter/nvidia/blackwell.md`) |

# Workflow

0. **Learn from prior attempts (this may be a RETRY).** Read `memory/v*.json` entries with
   `optimization.action_category="triton_to_gluon_conversion"` (`python tools/memory_manager.py read
   --workspace .`). The orchestrator re-issues conversion each time Triton re-plateaus, so earlier
   attempts may have failed or come out >5% slower — their `pitfalls_and_fixes` tell you which lowering
   to avoid. Take a **different** approach this time; do not repeat a recorded dead-end.
1. **Read the sheet** (only the one for `arch`). It carries the Triton→Gluon API map, the critical
   pitfalls, and pointers to the exact `reference-projects/triton` source. Open that source **only**
   for the construct you are converting — do not re-derive the whole API or read other arches' sheets.
2. **Extract real layouts** from the current kernel:
   `python tools/extract_ttgir.py <driver>.py -o <version>.ttgir`. The driver must launch the kernel
   (the kernel's `__main__` profiling block works). Confirm the TTGIR target matches `arch`
   (e.g. `cuda:100`). Reuse the real `#blocked`/`#shared`/`#tmem` layouts — **never fabricate layouts**.
3. **Rewrite `kernel.py` → Gluon** per the sheet: map loads → the arch's async/TMA + barrier pattern,
   matmuls → the arch's MMA + accumulator-residency pattern, and reproduce the original `num_stages`
   (nothing more). Keep the DPS `run(...)` signature (inputs then outputs). Change **only** `kernel.py`;
   if languages/deps/entry change, keep `solution.json` in sync (Gluon stays `languages:["triton"]`).
   Do **not** add tiling changes, split-K, fusion, or new pipelining — those are for later sessions.
4. **Validate** (the SOL harness is the only gate):
   `python -c "import kernel"` (compiles) → `timeout 1800 python test_kernel.py --version <version>`
   (real evaluator, every workload, per-workload tolerance). Iterate on compile/correctness fixes only.

# Output / commit gate — correctness AND performance parity (±5%)
A direct translation preserves the algorithm and the work, so the Gluon kernel must be **as fast as
the Triton kernel it came from**. Commit only if BOTH hold:
1. **All workloads PASS** (correctness), and
2. **Geomean latency within +5% of the Triton HEAD** — compare v<N>'s `performance.latency_us` to
   v<N-1>'s in memory. Faster is fine; **>5% slower is a defective conversion**, not acceptable.

- Both hold → commit `"v<N>: triton->gluon conversion (no opt, perf parity)"`; this Gluon kernel is the
  new HEAD and unlocks the deeper Gluon phase. Record `memory/v<N>.json` with
  `optimization.action_category="triton_to_gluon_conversion"`, PASS, and the ±% vs Triton.
- Correctness FAIL, or >5% slower after fix attempts → `git reset --hard HEAD` (restore Triton), record
  the blocker in `pitfalls_and_fixes`, and **commit the record even on revert**
  (`git add memory/v<N>.json plans/ && git commit -m "v<N>: conversion reverted (<reason>)"`) so the next
  attempt learns. Never force a slow/broken conversion through — the orchestrator re-checks parity and
  will revert a >5%-slower commit anyway.

## Diagnosing a >5% regression (fix, don't accept)
A slower Gluon kernel almost always means a mechanical miss: `gl.load`+`smem.store` instead of the
arch's async/TMA copy; a wrong or fabricated layout forcing extra conversions; accumulator not resident
in the right memory (registers vs TMEM); or a missing pipeline the Triton had. Re-read the sheet's
pitfalls and the cited source, fix the specific construct, and re-measure.

# Constraints
- Convert only — no optimization, no algorithm change, no shape bucketing.
- Never fabricate layouts; extract from TTGIR or derive via the arch's documented helpers.
- Never use another vendor's Gluon APIs (e.g. `gl.amd.*` on NVIDIA → unregistered-dialect crash).
- Do not edit `test_kernel.py`, `definition.json`, `reference.py`, or `workload.jsonl`.
